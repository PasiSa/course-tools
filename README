points.pl	Reads points from csv files fetched from TMC for one module
		(given as parameter). One file is fetched at primary
		deadline, other is at the secondary deadline and gives
		half points. Produces csv file with combined
		information:
		"student id,full-point-exercises,half-point-exercises"

output.pl	Produces html output of the points in different
		modules, based on output created by points.pl. Shows
		scoring information, taking into account the full
		point / half point separation. Also shows how many
		modules are succesfully accepted.

make-csv.pl	Produces csv file with similar information than what
		output.pl produces. Could be imported to excel, for
		example.
